// A thread is the path followed when executing a program. All java programs have at least
//one thread, known as the main thread, which is created by the JVM at the program start,
//when the main() method is invoked with the main thread.

// In java creating a thread is accomplished by implementing an interface and extending a class.
//Every java thread is created and controlled by the java.lang.thread class.

// A single-threaded application has only one thread and can handle only one task at a time.
// To handle multiple tasks in parallel,multi-threading is used: multiple threads are created,
// each performing a different task.
